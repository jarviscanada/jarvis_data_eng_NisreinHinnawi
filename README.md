# Nisrein Hinnawi . Jarvis Consulting

I completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jordan University of Science and Technology and a Diploma degree in Computer Programming from Seneca College with honor, and I have a. During my studies, I have grown immense interest and enthusiasm in the field of research and development due to its innovative nature. Thinking out of the box, implementing new ideas, and finally developing those ideas into innovations are some of the main reasons which attract me into this field. I can work on different project platforms built with Java, C/C++, or C#. I can adapt and be an active team member in a short time, learn quickly new techniques and software as I have a strong and thorough understanding of programming languages, and meet stringent deadlines if required.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisreinHinnawi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisreinHinnawi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisreinHinnawi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that helps the user record and monitors hardware specifications and usage information (e.g. CPU, RAM, Disk, etc.) for a Linux cluster in real-time and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. The program was developed in Bash Scripts and tested on a virtual machine that uses CentOS 7 distribution, and the Docker container was used to provision the PostgreSQL database.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisreinHinnawi/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Implemented Java program to learn about JDBC (Java Database connectivity) and data access-designed patterns. The application uses JDBC to connect Java to the PostgreSQL database for running queries and perform the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the local PostgreSQL instance via transactions. Docker container was used to provision the PostgreSQL database. SQL scripts were used to create the database and its tables. The program was tested by executing the same queries once inside the database instance, and once using JDBCExecuter class to ensure that the results are the same.
  - Grep App:  Implemented JavaGrep application using Java 8 and its latest feature Stream API and Lambda, the application similar to the Linux built-in grep feature, it searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and outputs matched lines to a file.  The program was compiled using the Maven tool, packaged using Docker, pushed to Docker Hub, and deployed to GitHub. The program was tested on sample text files that contain different amounts of data. Then the results were stored in an output text file.


## Highlighted Projects
**CuteMe Application**: Built an Application using Client/Server architecture using Xamarin platform (C# Language) to show the users list of adoptable animals and allow them to get details about the animal, browse their photos, and mark any as favorite. The data was retrieved by using RESTful API services from Petfinder.com and was cached using SQLite for optimization. The Client-side has been implemented using an MVVM architectural pattern to keep the View and the logic separated. The application was tested using a real phone and emulator.

**Live Video Editor**: Implemented face detection and identity hiding application using Java language to hide people's identities from others while streaming live videos on TV or the internet. OpenCV was used to perform image processing and to run object detection algorithms for human faces and then pixelate or replace the detected area with a staging image to hide the user identity.

**DBLP Fast Searching Graduation Project**: Processed large-scale streaming data using Spark/Scala and Apache Hadoop. Operated huge data using DBLP dataset with more than 3.3 million records. DBLP was converted from XML to JSON using Java to make it easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Represented DBLP data set using Postgres SQL database. The application was tested on an Ubuntu machine and using SQL queries.

**My Airbnb Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nesreen-henawi/WEB322)]: Built a travel website using Client/Server architecture using the Node JS platform to allow travellers to find a place to stay around the world, the website has many functionalities that allow the users to search and find what they want fast and easily. MongoDB was used to store user data, reservation data, and room information.

**247 Garage Sale Web Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nesreen-henawi/247GarageSale)]: Built a garage sale website using JavaScript language to do online garage sale shopping. The website has many sections and items that the user can browse by pictures, descriptions, and prices for each item. HTML was used to structure the website content, and CSS was used to define the style of the web pages.
