# Nisrein Hinnawi . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated with a Diploma degree in Computer Programming from Seneca College with honor, and I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jordan University of Science and Technology. During my studies, I have grown immense interest and enthusiasm in the field of research and development due to its innovative nature. Thinking out of the box, implementing new ideas, and finally developing those ideas into innovations are some of the main reasons which attract me into this field. I have the critical skills and knowledge which the market is looking for. I can work on different project platforms built with Java, C/C++, or C#. I have the ability to adapt and be an active team member in a short time, learn quickly new techniques and software as I have a strong and thorough understanding of programming languages, and meet stringent deadlines if required.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisreinHinnawi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux monitoring agent that helps the user record and monitor hardware specifications and usage information (e.g. CPU, RAM, Disk, etc.) for a Linux cluster in real-time and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. The program was developed in Bash Scripts and tested on a virtual machine that uses CentOS 7 distribution, and the Docker container was used to provision the PostgreSQL database.

## Highlighted Projects
**CuteMe Application:**: the application idea is to show the users list of adoptable animals and allow them to get details about the animal, browse their photos, and mark any as favorite. The app provides the user with many functionalities. The application was built using Client/Server architecture using Xamarin platform (C# Language), the data was retrieved by using RESTful API services from Petfinder.com, and was cached using SQLite for optimization. The Client-side has been implemented using an MVVM architectural pattern to keep the View and the logic separated.

**Live Video Editor:**: face detection and identity hiding a smart tool in order to hide people's identities from others while streaming live videos on TV or the internet. The application was built using Java language. OpenCV was used to perform image processing and to run object detection algorithms for human faces and then pixelate or replace the detected area with a staging image to hide the user identity.

**DBLP Fast Searching Graduation Project:**: processing large-scale streaming data with Spark Using DBLP dataset with more than 3.3 million records. The application was built using Spark, Apache Hadoop, and Postgres SQL for parsing and processing the large-scale dataset, therefore significantly reducing the search result by 25 times compared to regular SQL queries.

**My Airbnb Web Application:** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nesreen-henawi/WEB322)]: build a travel website that allows travelers to find a place to stay around the world, the website has many functionalities that allow the users to search and find what they want fast and easily. The application was built using Client/Server architecture using the Node JS platform (JavaScript Language). MongoDB was used to store user data, reservation data, and room information.

**247 Garage Sale Web Application:** [[GitHub](https://github.com/nesreen-henawi/247GarageSale)]: the idea of the application is to do an online garage sale. The website has many sections such as the toys section, home tools section, and more sections.  The user can browse each section's items which have pictures, descriptions, and prices for each item. The website was built using JavaScript language, HTML was used to structure the website content, and CSS was used to define the style of the web pages.
